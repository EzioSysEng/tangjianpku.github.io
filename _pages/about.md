I am currently an assistant professor at [HEC Montreal](http://www.hec.ca/) and [Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA)](https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/). Prior to that, I was a Postdoc at University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University. I also worked at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) as an associate researcher between 2014-2016.

======
* We just released the source codes of our RotatE model. The codes are available at [link](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding).
* I am quite honoured to be named to the first cohort of Canada CIFAR Artificial Intelligence Chairs (CCAI Chair).[CIFAR News1](https://www.cifar.ca/cifarnews/2018/12/06/trudeau-meets-with-newly-appointed-canada-cifar-ai-chairs) [CIFAR News2](https://www.cifar.ca/cifarnews/2018/12/03/29-researchers-named-to-first-cohort-of-canada-cifar-artificial-intelligence-chairs) 
* Tutorial "Graph representation learning" by William L. Hamilton and me has been accepted by AAAI'19. See you at Hawaii!!
 Slides ([Part 0](/files/AAAI19/aaai-grltutorial-part0-intro.pdf), [Part I](/files/AAAI19/aaai-grltutorial-part1-nodereps.pdf), [Part II](/files/AAAI19/aaai-grltutorial-part2-gnns.pdf), [Part III](/files/AAAI19/aaai-grltutorial-part3-generation.pdf))


* I'm looking for Ph.Ds, masters,and interns to work with me in the fields of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and deep graph representation learning with various applications. If you're interested, please send me an email or apply through the [MILA recruitment page](https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/cours/recruiting/)
