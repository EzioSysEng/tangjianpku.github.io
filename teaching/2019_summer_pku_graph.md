Introduction
======
Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world, covering a variety of applications ranging from social networks, recommender systems, knowledge graphs, computer vision, and drug discovery. To analyze graphs, an important prerequisite is to have effective representations of graphs, which largely determine the performance of most downstreaming tasks. In this course, I will introduce the latest progress on learning representations of graphs such as node representation learning, graph visualization, knowledge graph embedding, graph neural networks, graph generation and their applications to a variety of tasks.
